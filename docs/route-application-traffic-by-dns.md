# Route Application Traffic By DNS

## What

Provide IP address responses to DNS client lookups based on different criteria such as:

* Geographic location / governmental jurisdiction of the client and the server computers
* Network latency / distance between the client and server computers
* Traffic load across server computers
* Content or service availability across server computers

## Why

Route client request traffic to the IP
