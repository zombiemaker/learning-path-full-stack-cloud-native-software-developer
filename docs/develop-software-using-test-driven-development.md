## TDD Principles

1. Write NO production code expect to pass a failing test
1. Write only enough of a test to demonstrate a failure
1. Write only enough production code to pass the test

## TDD Benefits

* Reduce debugging time
* Generate reliable low-level documentation
* Decouple your design
* Eliminate the fear of changing the code
* Can clean code without fear

## Related Concepts

* Test doubles
* Use cases
* User stories
